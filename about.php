					<p>Hello, Thank you for visiting our website! We are group 17 and our members are<br>
										Corinne, Mark, Jun, Suki, and Elly. We are all currently students in BCIT CST program.<br>
										This website, which is our first project, introduces 5 dessert recipes. Each dessert<br>
										was actually made by our group members. The fun thing about our website is that users<br>
										can send us their own dessert recipes by the "Contact Us" page and after we go over <br>
										them we will choose one of the recipes sent by the users and upload it as our new content!<br>
										Please feel free to contact us and send us your own special dessert recipes!
